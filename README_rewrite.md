# React Rewrite Branch (react-rewrite)

This branch is a complete rewrite of the original Xiao8 project using React and JSX, with the goal of unifying the frontend and backend under a single, modern, cross-platform codebase.

## 🔍 Purpose

- Rebuild the entire project architecture using React
- Support cross-platform usage: Web, iOS, and Android via Expo and React Native
- Use JSX throughout to simplify development and component reuse
- Maintain full separation from the `main` branch to ensure stability of the original codebase

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This is an early-stage, in-progress rewrite. Features and structure may change rapidly.

## 📦 Technologies Planned

- React
- Expo + React Native
- Next.js (for potential Web support)
- TypeScript
- Serverless API integration (e.g., Google Gemini)

## 🤝 Contributions

This branch is open for collaboration, but should not be merged into `main` until it's stable. If you're interested in helping with the rewrite or testing new features, feel free to open a pull request or issue.
